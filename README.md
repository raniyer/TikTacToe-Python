Tic-Tac-Toe game is an easy game which is mostly played among children and it also helps them to improve their concentration.

The objective of this tic-tac-toe game python project is to build a tic-tac-toe game so you can play it without wasting paper and improve your concentration. To build this game we use the tkinter module with the concept of python.

To play this game we require two players to play one is X and the other is O and both players play by putting their marks in empty squares.

To win the game players have to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally).
